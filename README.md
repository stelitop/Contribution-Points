This is an older program I made when I still didn't know how to use the graphical framework I use today.
There are a lot of menus to go through but here is what you need to know:
The original idea of this program was to help make a "Trading" system, kind of like a marketplace, for our guild members, where they could contribute materials for our currency - Contribution Points (CP). Then, they could purchase whatever materials they needed
In the program itself there is a list of players, and a list of materials in the categories: Mining, Smithing and Alchemy. The database saves information, such as how much a player has contributed in total, how much currency he currently owns, and what materials he has contributed with.
The values for the item prices are easilty adjustable. The menus are very selfexplanatory. To change the menu you are currently in you can just hit the keayboard button required for it.
