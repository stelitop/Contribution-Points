This is a lightweight console application used for managing the materials for my guild in an MMORPG. 

The idea is to provide a currency - Contribution Points (CP) that can be used as a means of trading in the guild. Player can exchange materials for CP, that can be also spent on getting items from the guild bank.

To navigate, click on the indicated key in the menu.

New items and players can be created when needed, and there is a cost rate that can be adjusted (items are bought for less than they are sold for). Items are separated into 3 major categories - Mining, Smithing and Alchemy.

Once changes have been made press 'S' in the main menu to update the file with the information.
